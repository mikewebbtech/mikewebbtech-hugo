Always use the graceful method unless absolutely necessary.  i.e don't just yank the power cord out

Graceful method with physical access to device with no console: Press and immediately release the Power button. The device begins gracefully shutting down the operating system and then powers itself off

Graceful method while logged in via terminal or console (CLI method):

```
root@srx320> request system power-off
Power Off the system ? [yes,no] (no) yes

Shutdown NOW!
[pid 2480]

root@srx320>
