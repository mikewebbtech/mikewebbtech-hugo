summary: My hard drives were spinning at 7600 RPM 24/7, this is fine for aa actual server for the masses or in DC, but total overkill for my intermittent needs. Why do I want power control over my spinning rust...spin down to save noise and heat = save energy.

My hard drives were spinning at 7600 RPM 24/7...Arrgg!

Why do I want power control over my spinning rust...spin down to save noise and heat = save energy

For my home lab I buy enterprise HDD's from ebay et al at amazing price points per Gb.  Very few have issues  but all need some amount attention beyond that when purchasing consumer grade new.

My defaults are to always integrate and update and wipe with a bad blocks check , adjust block size if needed  and stress test prior to adding them to a storage pool.

My latest acquisitions were 8 x 4Tb SAS drives.  HGST Ultrastar 7K600 ($50 each).  After doing my default and setting up a pool (RAID2z) and having the server run for awhile, I realised that the PWM fans wouldn't throttle.

After writing a little script to monitor temperature and fan sensors via IPMI and then querying the HDD temps using smartmontools, it became clear that the unaccounted heat was coming from the HDD's.  They weren't spinning down, but why and how to change that behavior.

These are SCSI drives, the usual hdparm tool command don't work.

Examine smarttools extended output with background media scan (BMS) is active

Background scan results log

Accumulated power on time, hours:minutes 763:09 [45786 minutes]
Number of background scans performed: 8, scan progress: 66.08%
Number of background medium scans performed: 8
<--snip-->

```

Background scanning is active, this wont affect disk performance as "The BMS process works at idle time, when the disk received no commands" i.e. the disk wont spin down as usual when it is idle.

*(Please read the sdparm man page before blindly doing a copy paste and to get a better understanding of the options and switches. They may not be compatible with your drive.)*

Let's urn off BMS on this SAS drive

```
# sdparm --clear=EN_BMS --save /dev/sda

```

Query the disks abilty and value for standby

```
# sdparm --flexible -6 -p po -l /dev/sda | grep -e SCT
SCT 0 [cha: y, def: 0, sav: 0] Standby_z condition timer (100 ms)

```

No counters defined (SCT 0 = not countdown time till standby)

```
# sdparm --flexible -6 -p po -l /dev/sda | grep -e "STANDBY "
STANDBY 0 [cha: y, def: 0, sav: 0] Standby_z timer enable

```

Standby not enabled (STANDBY 0)

*what is Standby (standby\_Z)*
*• Heads are unloaded to drive ramp.*
*• Drive motor is spun down.*
*• Drive still responds to non-media access host commands*

Let's enable it

```
# sdparm --flexible -6 -v -S -p po --set=STANDBY=1 /dev/sda

```

Verify

```
# sdparm --flexible -6 -p po -l /dev/sda |grep -e "STANDBY "
STANDBY 1 [cha: y, def: 0, sav: 1] Standby_z timer enable

```

Set the SCT (Standby\_z condition timer in units of 100ms so 9000=15 minutes)

```
# sdparm --flexible -6 -v -S -p po --set=SCT=9000 /dev/sda

```

NOTE: IBCT (Idle\_b condition timer) has has a condition of 6000 (10 minutes) but is not enable (IDLE\_B 0) it.   Let's enable and reduce it down to 5 minutes as this is a disk used in a zpool for archives and backups and occasional media file access

*What is Idle\_B*
*• Disables most of the servo system, reduces processor and channel power consumption*
*• Heads are unloaded to drive ramp.*
*• Disks rotating at full speed (7200 RPM)*

```
# sdparm --flexible -6 -v -S -p po --set=IDLE_B=1 /dev/sda
mp_settings: page,subpage=0x1a,0x0 num=1
pdt=-1 start_byte=0x3 start_bit=2 num_bits=1 val=1 acronym: IDLE_B

mode sense (6) cdb: 1a 00 1a 00 34 00
mode select (6) cdb: 15 11 00 00 34 00
```


```
# sdparm --flexible -6 -v -S -p po --set=ICT=3000 /dev/sda

mode sense (6) cdb: 1a 00 1a 00 34 00
mode select (6) cdb: 15 11 00 00 34 00
```

Now verify the changes

```
# sdparm --flexible -6 -p po -l /dev/sda |grep -e "ICT\|IDLE_C "
IDLE_C 1 [cha: y, def: 0, sav: 1] Idle_c timer enable
ICT 3000 [cha: y, def: 20, sav:3000] Idle_a condition timer (100 ms)
```

Repeat all of the above for all SAS drives in your storage pool. (hint FOR LOOP)
Bonus points: Reboot and verify changes to power condition survives power cycle.

I just need to workout how to get the power state of the drives. I see a difference in power consumption as the drives draw less power and the chassis is cooler so the PWM fans drop to around 500-600 RPM, drawing less power, instead of screaming at 1600RPM. But everytime I use smartctl to query the drives it must bee spinning them up again as noise, heat and power consumption goes up.

Beer and profit people!
