Well after a short stay at home (sorry Tan), I'm waiting at Perth airport off to another job. Caltex in Sydney for 20 odd days doing something, not to sure yet, for CR. No doubt it will be smelly and dirty. At least it will be cooler then Veranus Island.

Got my strongest nibble yet so far for a long term dive job in Malaysia. I will wait and see how that pans out. Fingers crossed.
