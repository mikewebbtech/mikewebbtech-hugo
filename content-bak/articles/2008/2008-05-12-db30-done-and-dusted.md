Got the official end of contract in the mail the other day, so thayts all folks for the topside work on the barge. McD's were making noises that sounded like there was sat support comming up for air divers, but thats all it turned out to be..just noise. Oh well funn was had and money made by all.

On the upside they gave me a date for application submitions for the Bass Straight job early next year. Might put my hat in for a job doing stinger checks. A lot could happen by then
