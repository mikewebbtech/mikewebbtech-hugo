summary: Getting shafted by companies canning a job last minute is the name of the game I guess. First they rang me up, booked me in and gave me the onboarding headache then go to ground ghosting or dangle the carrot or worst, the next week, next week...then no go.  while turning down other opportunities.

Shafted by another company (a different one this time) that had already canned a job on me.

First time they rang me up, booked me in and gave me the spiel. sounded great, about 3 weeks and by the sounds of it, no HAZMAT entry to be made (long line BA and chemical suits).  Yeah other work work offers came in after I accepted the job, but being professional, I knocked them back as I had made a commitment, to the first offer.  Sure enough, a few days before the job started, they call and say its been postponed a month and...um...sorry but tough luck.

Any way, they call back a some time later and say they have a job going offshore (something I gave  done before at the same place for them), it's only a week but should take me up to the Karratha job that got postponed (which will then flow on to another week long job).  Sound great and I just had that dive job fall out.

Alright now, still bearing with this, we now get to the core of my angst here.  I have written my self off as far as other work goes for the next month so I have been saying no to job offers.  I call then today to get the details on what what's happening after the Veranus job only to be told that due to scheduling, I have not been crewed for the Karratha job.  Basically, because they put me on the One week job, I have lost out the original 3 week job I was crewed on too.  AND, HR did have enough time to reschedule my placements.  Yep, you guessed it, a quick call to the other companies I turned down was not good, they filled the positions.

Man I'm getting sick of that company, they f*#ked me over last year major on a job.  I might make this this the last job I do for them.

There has been I common thread this month, I'm still trying to work out what it is I should be learning from it.
