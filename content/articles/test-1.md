Each of my posts has a folder named ‘images’ alongside it. For example, I have a folder called ‘Blogs’ which contains ‘blog_1.md’ and a folder named ‘images’ which contains ‘logo.png’.

On my homepage (index.html), I have all my posts listed by their urls to access them. Next to these urls I would like each posts ‘logo.png’ to be next to them. Does anyone know how I can go about this?
gosh!

I am referencing a footnote[^1]

```go {linenos=inline}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("{linenos=inline}")
}
```

```go {linenos=table}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("{linenos=table}")
}
```
