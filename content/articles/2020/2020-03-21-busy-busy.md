It’s been a flat out year so far with work doing various commissioning and testing jobs around OZ. 

 With all that has been happening lately with COVID-19 and the risk of getting locked down in a remote workers camp, I’ll be finishing up on this project and heading home to ride out the pandemic to either be safe with my family or look after them or them look after me. Who knows how this will play out? 
 
 This will be much needed time to reconnect, study, work on my little projects and concentrate on the house build. 
 
 Stay safe
