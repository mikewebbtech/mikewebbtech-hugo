Callouts, or *admonitions*, are styled content blocks used in documentation and blogs to highlight important information such as tips, warnings, or notes. Their purpose is to improve readability by drawing attention to key details. Advantages include clearer communication, reduced risk of overlooked information, and a more structured, professional presentation.

## Error Test

> [!NOSUPPORT]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

## GitHub Test

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

## Callout Overview

> [!ABSTRACT]
> Abstract: This paper discusses the advantages and challenges of microservice architecture.

> [!CODE]
> Code snippet:
>
> ```javascript
> function fetchData() {
>   return axios.get("/api/data");
> }
> ```

> [!CONCLUSION]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.


> [!INFO]
> System status: All services are operating normally. Current uptime: 99.99%.


> [!MEMO]
> Memo: Technical review meeting scheduled for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM.


> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.


> [!NOTIFY]

## Foldable Admonitions

> [!NOTE]- Here are the details regarding API usage:
>
> - **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/users` is used to fetch the user list.
> - **Authentication**: A valid `Bearer` token must be provided in the request header.

## Nested Admonitions

> [!question] Can admonitions be nested?
>
> > [!todo] Yes!, they can.
> >
> > > # [!example] You can even use multiple layers of nesting.
