The Wordpress.com gouging is over. Since moving to a new house with business class internet and a new server rack with a High availability server/storage solution, I'm in the process of moving existing paid subscription services and other external hosted SaaS wallet drains over to self hosting. I'll try to keep everything up and running whole I move and convert to a new setup.

Time for a beer(s)

**UPDATE**

Had a few false starts and failures.  But now have moved over to self hosting using containers, treafik and Cloudflare tunnels and Wordpress caching. Had some little bumps on the way and a larger learning curve then expected and much beer was had, but got there. Looking forward to reviewing and documenting the process in future posts.
