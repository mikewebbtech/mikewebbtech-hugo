	I upgraded to MacOS Mojave (from High Sierra) and so far had a smooth transition.  I had do the ol' update upgrade everything for a number of things to get them to work (e.g. macports) but the one thing that I use a lot that wouldn't play nice was the Beatport Pro application.  Start crash since repeat.

In an act of desperation I tried replicating a part of the dropbox install process.  When I installed dropbox it asked me, ever so politely,  to manually add it to my Security and Privacy settings under System Preferences.  I did the same thing for Beatport Pro and YAY!
