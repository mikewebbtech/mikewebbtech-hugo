dd has being my go to tool for everything-imges-and-iso, especially ever since the usb stick became ubiquitous and norm for installing new a OS.

For the past month I've been trying out a new way/tool on both linux and MacOS called etcher.  It's light weight and easy to use.  Have a look on github

<https://github.com/resin-io/etcher>

For sure, pulling up a terminal and sudo dd-ing is still by far faster then the clickfest of a gui. But if the lazy stick hits you at he moment of boot disk creation, Etcher has your back.

*Nothing beats dd when used with the 1-2 ssh-screen combo power punch
