> ## What am I about?
> {.one}

In short my main goal in life is contentment.

For me, contentment is not something that just happens; it grows when I take
personal responsibility for putting in the effort to get the outcomes that make
my life richer and more meaningful. It's not done until "I am happy with that".

I like to dig into the tech that boost my quality of life and help
me find more contentment along the way.

> ## What I do
> {.two}

I help organisations **stabilise IT infastructure and services**, **organise information**, **cybersecurity governance, risk and compliace and **enabling empowerment through training** ALL  with clear procedures, plain-English guides, and a calm, methodical approach.

- **IT & Networking:** Microsoft 365, AD/GPO, Windows 10/11, structured file services/SharePoint (practical), VLAN/VPN fundamentals, backup & restore habits.
- **Information Management:** controlled documentation, versioning/approvals, shared-folder standards, “draft → final” discipline, privacy/permissions awareness, staff training.
- **Mindset:** safety-critical discipline from oil & gas/mining — clear records, traceability, and changes that actually stick.

👉 **Hire me for**: L2 desktop support, Infrastructure administration, information/records management uplift, and user training.

> ## Why trust me
> {.three}

- **Proven in regulated environments.** Years of inspection test plans, evidence packs, and sign-offs taught me to keep records audit-ready.
- **Process that respects people.** I fix the busy areas first, reduce duplicates, and make files easier to find — then I teach the habit in one page.
- **Always learning.** Cert IV (Networking), Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, AWS Cloud Foundations, ISO 27001 Annex A Controls, Fortinet Associate, and more.

> ## The Short story
> {.four}

- **Started early:** BBS, dial-up, beige boxes, Doom over serial — then Unix/Linux and school/local-gov support.
- **Went heavy industry:** testing/commissioning in oil & gas/mining where documentation quality equals safety; wrote procedures, inspection plans, and close-out packs.
- **Now:** Freelance **Infrastructure Support Specialist** and student of networks & IM — designing small business networks, tidying shared content, and writing guides teams actually use.
- **Next:** Roles that combine **IT support + information management + training**, especially in government, healthcare, and resources.

1. **Listen** to what the pain points are.
2. **Tidy the high-use areas** first (clear names, fewer duplicates, sensible structure).
3. **Write the one-pager** people will actually follow.
4. **Check adoption**, adjust, and repeat.

If you want dependable IT Infrastructure support and cleaner information practices, **let’s talk**.
