> ### What am I about?
> {.one}

In short my main goal in life is contentment.

For me, contentment is not something that just happens; it grows when I take
personal responsibility for putting in the effort to get the outcomes that make
my life richer and more meaningful. It's not done until "I am happy with that".

I like to dig into the tech that boost my quality of life and help
me find more contentment along the way.

> ### Where do I come from?
> {.two}

From a time of dialup and the BBS, flipping dip switches on a modem to set the
IRQ, tweaking Hayes commands and running IPX over serial to play Doom. The
world of the i386 in a beige box and a monitor that x-rayed your eyeballs.
I could go on, but to be honest it was before that, and I find that just a
little bit daunting.

I have been fascinated with the potential of technology as a child since I
watched my first sci-fi show on TV.

> ### Professional History
> {.three}

- An exciting life as a qualified Chef and Horticulturist in viticulture.

- Systems, Network and Database integrator and solutions provider for schools,
  local government, and local business in the region. As well as an outsourced
  Linux and Cisco systems specialist for remote and local MSP's.

- Then randomly pivoted on to a very successful career in the offshore, oil and
  gas and mining sector, starting out as a rope access technician, commercial
  diver and diving medical technician. I progressed to be a technical access
  specialist with a few roles in qa/qc admin. This lead to many years working in
  pre-commissioning and commissioning roles, primarily testing pipelines and
  process piping systems

- After a lot of training and experience in specialist equipment, proprietary
  processes and managing teams, I was deployed to projects as a subject
  matter specialist to integrate with the clients team to help them with
  compliance, procedure development, inspection test planing and test record
  creation, integrity and final acceptance as the accredited person.

_THEN_

- Studied ITC and zeroed in on Unix systems working on Solaris, AIX
  and Berkeley Unix (BSD Unix) servers then installed my first Linux system,
  Yggdrasil Linux, from a borrowed cdrom. Then started offering commercial
  solutions and support based on Slackware. Moved to RedHat as the version for
  my clients when the HCE certification program was introduced.

- Numerous vendor, industry, and government mandated certifications and
  competencies in equipment use, process and procedure application, Health,
  Safety, Environment, Culture, security and team management.

_NOW_

- Full time student studying network and infrastructure. This provides
  the skills and knowledge to design, install and manage branch
  networks, on premise and cloud infrastructure

- This qualification includes core skills in policy development. programming,
  ethics and privacy, cyber risk management, critical thinking, emerging
  technology research, teamwork and client support. There is a lot of theory with
  a high standard on fundamentals and creating solutions for small and large
  businesses using equipment and vendor services such as Microsoft, VMware,
  Linux, Amazon Web services, Microsoft Azure and Fortinet.

_GOALS_

- With my full time study, I still have time for side quests to gain
  additional vendor, leadership and industry certification and interest stream
