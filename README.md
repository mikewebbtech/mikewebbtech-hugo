## Hugo

> **QUOTE**
> "The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites"

Hugo is a static site generator framework written in go and sites are created using html templates with embedded go template language snippets. The content for the site is generated from text files such as markdown, json, asciiDoc etc.

The [hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation) is extensive and well structured and there is an active community to lean on for help. There are lots of blog articles and theme examples to draw inspiration and get started with creating a site. If an existing theme meets your needs, hugo is even easier and faster to get started with.

**What is a SSG and Why?**
Static site generators offer faster performance, enhanced security, and greater scalability by pre-building web pages as static files rather than generating them on demand using a database backend. This approach simplifies hosting and maintenance, allows for better content version control, and provides a lighter backend with fewer dependencies. As a result, static sites are more reliable, more secure, and often offer better SEO due to their speed.
